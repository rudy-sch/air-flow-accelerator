Air Flow Accelerator Systems in the House based on Exhaust Fan

Abstract:

Limited space, especially in urban areas, causes the backyard in the house which should function to facilitate air circulation in order to maintain the quality of the air inside the house, switch function to become another functional space.
The development of exhaust fan-based devices that can be controlled using a smartphone and displaying surrounding air quality information is expected to help solve the problem.
This device has a fan system to control the exhaust fan speed, a communication system that manages communication between the smartphone and the exhaust fan, a sensor system to detect surrounding air quality, a power supply system and an interface to display air quality information and control the exhaust fan.
The capacity of exhaust fan used in the fan system is 480 CMH. 
The test results show the fan system can control the exhaust fan in three different speed operations, low, medium, and high speed.
Noise produced by the exhaust fan is below 55 dB. The device can be controlled with smartphone using Bluetooth communication from a distance within 5 meters with wall barrier.
The sensor subsystem can provide reading results with an accuracy rate above 82%. The power supply system successfully supplies power to the entire system properly. Casing made for the system can not be made dustproof and resistant to water droplets.
